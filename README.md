Image Processing Using AI Neural Networks for Hand Gesture Recognition, To Translate Sign Language to Text.

Welcome to the signLanguageToText wiki!

In many countries, good quality interpreter services are hard to come by, or unaffordable to many. The main challenge I wish to solve is the lack of resources available for deaf people and created a web application combined with an image processing and deep neural network for gesture recognition, which will be used to detect Sign Language on a camera, which will then translate to text.

This system will be very helpful for deaf people, especially in online education, where they can sign language to text when in video conversations, or in other sectors such as businesses. This will help remove barriers which prevents the hearing-impaired to communicate with others.

This project I initially created for my final year project at university for my Computer Science degree, but I am a strong believer of Open Source. I believe code should be shared to benefit others, whether it's for research, to edit, to share, etc.

Thanks!
